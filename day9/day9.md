# 9.1 The Basic Yield:

    Such a amazing factory product,
    Which returns one after another,
    If you just call them up, 
    Otherwise never ever.

A generator function that produces values lazily,
yielding one item at a time on demand,
pausing execution between calls,
resuming right where it left off
efficient memory usage, infinite sequences made possible.
